# ScienceMotion

*This is an application to learn the concepts of high-school level science through animation*

*Scientific theories are about how shapes move in space, so we believe animation is the best way to explain them*


See the live site [here:](https://jessicaml.github.io/ScienceMotion-Static)


## Goals

- To create something as fun as MTV or Sesame Street to look at, that teaches the concepts of high-school level science.

- To get users to view and enjoy our animations - from high-school students, to retired dads to freelance bird-watching experts.
